BattleShip
==========

Project for CSC524 at the University of Miami.

---

Dear grader, this project was made by Shahzaib Majid and Matthew Sanchez.

The Makefile does the following:

	"make" will create an executable "server" file from BattleServer.c, 
	along with another executable "client" from client.c

	"make clean" will remove the two above executables.

To test this, please run the server in one terminal, and run each of the two
clients in their own terminals, for a total of three terminals. After that,
just follow the directions given to you by the program.

If you have any questions, email us at our student email.
